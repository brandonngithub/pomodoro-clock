[LIVE DEMO](https://brandonngithub.github.io/pomodor-clock/)
<p>In doing this project I learned when and how to lift a state up to its parent component. I also learned how to pass data from a parent component to a child component as well as how to use the useRef React hook to manipulate DOM elements. Another thing that improved throughout this project is my TailwindCSS proficiency.</p>

## Tech Used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
