[LIVE DEMO](https://brandonngithub.github.io/pomodor-clock/)
<p>This project helped me understand how to read and set state in a functional component. In doing this project I learned when and how to lift a state up to its parent component. I also learned how to pass data from a parent component to a child component. By doing this project I was able to get more comfortable and better my skills using TailwindCSS. I also learned how to use the useRef React hook to manipulate DOM elements.</p>

## Tech Used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
